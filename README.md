# Vue 3 + Vite

In this project, I created a Vue.js application using Recipe book API. 

On the main page, you can see 9 random recipe cards. Each card has its own page and a link to the YouTube video review of the dish. In the header, there are also pages where you can find recipes by name, the first letter of the dish, or ingredients.


By choosing a recipe and going to the dish card, we can see a photo of the dish, a description of the cooking process, the ingredients and their quantity, and a link to YouTube, or, if available, the original website with the recipe.
